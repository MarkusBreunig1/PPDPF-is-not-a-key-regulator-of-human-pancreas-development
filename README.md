corresponding to RNA-seq bulk analysis in above titled publication in PLOS Genetics - Breunig et al. 2025

Repository Aim:
- Providing access to data and codes in perpetuity

Repository Structure:
- Structure: two branches 
    branch 1: R Codes (Note: Make sure R and used packages are installed prior to run codes)
    branch 2: Data to be load for running R Codes (Note: Before you run codes in branch 1, you will need to download at least the GSE282625_ReadCounts_NotNormalized.txt file)
- codes were run in the paper with R v4.2.1, compatability has been confirmed for R v4.4.3
- Original FASTQ files are deposited under GSE282625 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE282625
